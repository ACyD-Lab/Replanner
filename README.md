Instructions for leveraging the project:<br />

1. Q-learning file contains the implementation for standard Q-learning algorithm. <br />

2. Economic Q-learning file contains the implementation for our proposed economic Q-learning algorithm. <br />

3. func file contains the necessary functions for the Q-learning and Economic Q-learning files. <br />

4. AirSim_file_gen generates the usable files for AirSim simulator by using the output files. <br />
